# Sample Projects
Collection of example System Design projects.

## What is it?
In real life we work on different projects, but rarely we have the ability to share them
publicly to learn from each others. There are lots of system design articles/books/videos
but most of them doesn't come with implementations to share the underlying details. 

This repo is here to collect some projects that are far from production ready, but displays
and shares some perspective of a scalable production system with implementation details. The
two purpose of this repo is:
  1. Share some implementation level perspective of a system to learn from and improve ourselves,
  2. Reuse some code and structure to build other production ready projects.

Ideally each project should be in its own repo, but we have decided to collect all the projects
in one repo to make it easier to find and share.
