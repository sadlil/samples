# GoLink

## Problem Statement
Design a URL shortener service like goo.gl or bit.ly. The service should support specifying
custom short URL by user as well as random unique urls. It should show a list of the urls
created by users with click count. Support editing and deleting of the exiting short urls.

### Non Goals
This system doesn't consider user management. No authentication, No session management.
Considering all the APIs as public, and owned by everyone.
